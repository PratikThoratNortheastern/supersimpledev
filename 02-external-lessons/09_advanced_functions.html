      // All these will return some or the other value or used as a value since functions in javascript are a value

      // setTimeout.
      // set timeout takes in a callback function as the first parameter.
      // set timeout takes the wait time for the function as a second parameter

      // Asynchronous code

      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("hello");
      }, 2000);
      // console.log("statement written after set timeout");

      /* if we notice, the console statement will execute first and then the setTimeout will execute.
What happens here is that setTimeout does not pause the execution but rather sets a timer and immediately goes to the next line to execute other code. This is why it is called asynchronous code.

Async code: the code will not wait for the current line to finish execution and go to other lines.
Synchronous code: the code will wait current line to finish its execution before moving to the next line.

Async code is basically like a background timer. it will not interfere with your current tasks
*/

      // setInterval()
      // it takes same two parameters as set timeout. a function we want to execute in future and a timer
      // But setInterval will keep playing the function every 3 seconds.

        console.log("set interval code");
      }, 3000);

        console.log("hello");
